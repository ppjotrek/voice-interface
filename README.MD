### Voice interface project

This repository is part of a Voice Interface course of Biomedical Engineering degree at AGH UST.

The goal of this repository was to design a simple app controlled by user's voice. Some of the scripts (in the assignment dir) are not prepared by me, but were part of the assignment.
